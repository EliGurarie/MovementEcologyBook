### I. Basic manipulations of movement data

a. Provide a brief summary of the data - what is it, where did it come from, 


> In part to illustrate some places where movement data are "tucked away" in R, here's an example of a [mouflon (*Ovis gmelini*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouflon) in the `adehabitatLT` package. This particular mouflon was tracked in 2003 somewhere in southern France, data from the Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage - the national game and wildlife agency of France.

b.  Load the data, convert the coordinates to complex numbers, plot the data (with a fixed aspect ratio)

> The following bit of code extracts one of two mouflons in the package, retaining only the *x*, *y* and *date* (time) columns, which as all we need.  Note that the time vector is already in POSIX format. 

```{r}
require(adehabitatLT)
# See all the data in the package by running:
## >  data(package = "adehabitatLT")
data(mouflon)  # loads the data.  
mouflon <- as.data.frame(mouflon[[1]][,1:3])
str(mouflon)
```

> There is a bit of an issue with some missing observations in these data

```{r}
table(is.na(mouflon$x))
```

> A simple way to tidy those (for our purposes) is simply:

```{r}
mouflon <- na.omit(mouflon)
```



> Creating a complex vector and plotting the movement:

```{r}
mouflon$z <- mouflon$x + 1i * mouflon$y
plot(mouflon$z, asp = 1, type = "o")
```

c.  Report some basic stats: how many observations are there; what is the sampling rate (aka *duty cycle*); what is the total extent in the east-west direction and north-south direction?

> Check out this R markdown trick for reporting stats.  If I type:

```{eval = FALSE}
There are `r nrow(mouflon)` locations in the data base, spanning `r round(diff(range(mouflon$x)))` m East-West, and `r round(diff(range(mouflon$y)))` m North-South. 
```

> The output is: *There are `r nrow(mouflon)` locations in the data base, spanning `r round(diff(range(mouflon$x)))` m East-West, and `r round(diff(range(mouflon$y)))` m North-South.*, and so on.  The other important piece of infromation I asked for was the sampling rate, which is obtained by:

```{r}
dT <- difftime(mouflon$date[-1], mouflon$date[-nrow(mouflon)], "minutes")
table(round(dT,-1))
```

> almost all of the time intervals are 20 minutes, with a few 40 minute intervals (because of single missing locations), and one of 140 minutes (because of 6 missing locations). 

d.  Compute the **step lengths** ($S$), report the mean, standard deviation, and draw a histogram,

```{r}
dS <- Mod(diff(mouflon$z))
mean(dS)
sd(dS)
hist(dS, breaks = 50, col = "grey",xlab = "step length (m)")
```

> So, in 20 minutes the mouflon typically moves 50 m (sd 50 m).  **POP QUIZ: What is a distribution where the mean and standard deviation are equal?**  Note also that since not ALL step durations are 20 minutes, this is a slightly biased analysis.

```{r}
mouflon[which.max(dS) + c(-1:1),]
```





e.  Compute the **absolute orientations** of the steps ($\Phi$), report the *mean* ($\widehat{\mu} = \overline{\Phi}$), the *mean cosine* ($\widehat{\rho} = \overline{\cos(\Phi)}$), and draw a histogram and rose diagram of the angles.

> The key is to take the argument of the *steps*, i.e. of `diff(z)`:

```{r}
Phi <- Arg(diff(mouflon$z))
```

> The rest follows directly

```{r, echo = -1}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
mean(Phi)
mean(cos(Phi))
hist(Phi, breaks = 20, col = "grey")
require(circular)
rose.diag(Phi, bins = 24, prop = 2, col = "grey")
```

> The angles are more less uniformy distributed between $-\pi$ and $\pi$ - as expected. The mean AND mean cosine are near 0, indiciating no overall orientation to the movement. 

f.  Perform the steps above for **turning angles** ($\Theta$).

> The turning angles are the *differences* in the absolute orientations: 

```{r}
Theta <- diff(Phi)
```

> The rest follows directly as abbove:

```{r, echo = -1}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
mean(Theta)
mean(cos(Theta))
hist(Theta, breaks = 20, col = "grey")
rose.diag(Theta, bins = 24, prop = 2, col = "grey")
```

> In this particular example, the turning angles are ALSO surprisingly uniform, and the mean cosine ($\rho$) is amazingly negative.  In MOST cases, it will be positive, to reflect a general persistence of movement in the same direction.  his is NOT typical of movement data, and (presumably) reflects the fact that the mouflon are (a) in a highly mountainous and often range limited.  If you look at the movement data, you will see that there are highly stationary states and a few displacements.  We can explore that hypothesis a little bit by filterin the data to larger step lengths.  Thus:

```{r}
steps <- diff(mouflon$z)
long_steps <- steps[Mod(steps) > 50]
mean(cos(diff(Arg(long_steps))))
rose.diag(cos(diff(Arg(long_steps))), prop = 2, col = "grey")
```

> Ah!  Much better. The $\widehat{\rho} > 0$, and most of the angles are "forward" looking. 

g.  What do you think the statistic $\widehat{\rho}$ tells you?

> If $\rho = 1$, all the movement is in the same direction.  If $\rho = 0$ the turning angles are completely random.  If $\rho < 0$ the movements tend to go back and forth.

### II. Simple statistics on spatial data (with some self-learning).

I emailed you a file, `AmericanBeech.csv` which contains the coordinates of American beech trees (*Fagus grandifola*) measured at SUNY-ESF's Adirondack Research Station in 1985, 2000 and 2009 (data courtesy of [M. Dovciak](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/dovciak/)).

(a) Load those data, convert the coordinates to complex numbers, and plot.

```{r, echo =-1, eval = -2}
require(magrittr); beech <- read.csv("_data/AmericanBeech.csv") %>% 
  subset(EAST < 50 & NORTH < 50)
beech <- read.csv("AmericanBeech.csv")
str(beech)
Z <- beech$EAST + 1i*beech$NORTH
plot(Z, asp = 1)
```

(b) Use `outer` and `apply` to compute the distance from each tree to it's nearest neighbor,

> To use `outer()`, you need a function that takes two arguments and returns a single value.  But those arguments can be *complex*!  So the distance between two points functions can be:

```{r}
getDistance <- function(z1, z2) Mod(z2 - z1)
```

> Applying this across all combinations of points giv es:

```{r}
D.matrix <- outer(Z, Z, getDistance)
```

Let's take a quick peek at this matix:

```{r}
D.matrix[1:5,1:5]
```

> This matrix is symmetric, because the distance between tree 1 and tree 2 is equal to the distance between tree 2 and tree 1.  And it has 0's along the diagonal, because the distance between a tree and itself is 0.  Actually, *any* symmetric matrix with 0's along the diagonals can be considered a  [distance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix) (or - formally - a distance matrix in a [*metric space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space)). The diagonal is not very interesting, so we could replace all of those 0's with NA's:

```{r}
diag(D.matrix) <- NA
```

> Now that we have a distance matrix, we can use `apply` along the rows (or columns) get the distance of the nearest tree:

```{r}
NN.distances <- apply(D.matrix, 1, min, na.rm = TRUE)
```

> If you want to do everthing in one line, it would look like this:

```{r}
NN.distances <- apply(outer(Z, Z, function(z1, z2) Mod(z1-z2)), 
                      1, function(x) min(x[x>0]))
```

> High-level stuff!  Two bespoke functions defined within a single line of code!

(c) Report the mean nearest neighbor distance, the inter-quartile intervals, and plot a histogram. Describe.

```{r}
summary(NN.distances)
hist(NN.distances, breaks = 40, col = "grey")
```

>  The mean & median nearest neighber distance between trees is about 2 meters, but it looks like there might be some *inhibition* in the growth of the beech trees, i.e. below the 2 meter peak, it is much less likely to find another tree within, say 1 meter.  There are real, biological  reasons for this, of course, that even non-plant ecologists might surmise!
